The Swift Package Manager for Kotlin Multiplatform Plugin, aka `spmForKmp` Gradle Plugin, is a tool designed to simplify integrating Swift Package Manager (SPM) dependencies into Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) projects and calling the native API.

It allows you to (almost) effortlessly configure and use Swift packages in your Kotlin projects targeting Apple platforms, such as iOS.
